# DataTalks ML Zoomcamp  

This repo will contain my journey throughout ML Zoomcamp 2023 by DataTalks.

While I am already familiar with basic concepts of Machine Learning, I will be participating for following reasons:  
- It's taught by Alexey 
- Based on Week 1, I see concepts such as normal equation being covered which I believe to be necessary for every data scientist to know and remember. This zoomcamp is definitely helpful for learning and relearning. 
- I have participated in Data Engineering zoomcamp where I enjoyed stepping out of comfort zone and I can't wait to do the same here! 
- Develop my leadership skills through learning and helping others as well in learning.

Stay tuned :)
